QuOATS is a webtool for querying datasets of genes and associated free text phenotype descriptions and annotations built using the [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) framework. The dataset contained here consists of genes across six plants species and their associated annotations and phenotype descriptions available through public databases including [TAIR](https://www.arabidopsis.org/), [MaizeGDB](https://www.maizegdb.org/), [Planteome](https://planteome.org/), and [SGN](https://solgenomics.net/). More information about the dataset is available [here](https://github.com/irbraun/plant-data). Four different methods of querying the dataset are provided, with examples and more information about each type of query provided in the table below. The utility of this tool with respect to this dataset of plant genes is further described in a preprint available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.04.429796v1). However, this tool can also be repurposed to support any dataset by replacing the underlying files. The code used for this tool is available [here](https://github.com/irbraun/quoats) as well as scripts to repopulate the tool with additional datasets and generate a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) image.

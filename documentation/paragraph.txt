## Overview
QuOATS is a webtool for querying datasets of genes and associated free text phenotype descriptions and annotations built using the [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) framework. The dataset contained here consists of genes across six plants species and their associated annotations and phenotype descriptions available through public databases including [TAIR](https://www.arabidopsis.org/), [MaizeGDB](https://www.maizegdb.org/), [Planteome](https://planteome.org/), and [SGN](https://solgenomics.net/). For more information about this dataset, see the corresponding [GitHub page](https://github.com/irbraun/plant-data). Four different methods of querying the dataset are provided, with examples and more information about each type of query provided in the table below. The utility of this tool with resepct to this dataset of plant genes will be further described in a preprint (in preparation). However, this tool can also be repurposed to support any dataset by replacing the underlying files. The [GitHub page](https://github.com/irbraun/quoats) for this webtool contains all the code used as well as the pipeline necessary to repopulate the tool with new datasets and generate a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) image.

### Description
This repository contains the code for a [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) application for querying datasets of phenotype descriptions using annotations with ontology terms as well as natural language. An instance of the tool is available at [quoats.dill-picl.org](https://quoats.dill-picl.org/) for querying a dataset of plant genes and their associated annotations and free text phenotype descriptions. More information about that dataset including where the data comes from and how it is preprocessed and formatted is available [here](https://github.com/irbraun/plant-data). This tool is associated with a publication about applying natural language processing approaches to plant phenotype data that is currently in preparation.
